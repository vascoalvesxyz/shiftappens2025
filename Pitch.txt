As people's lives get more complex they require more complex solutions to that end we want to make more and better tools that fits peoples needs. One way to organize and deal with these problems is the use of a mental palace in which you use objects to remember important notes.Our project Ballmer Notes aims to organize your notes in a 3d site where you can write notes in a digital space and store them for later. The idea is that you can create a digital mental palace, making it easier to remember these notes and you can acess it on your phone at any time. In the slide you can see a mockup of what happens in the site, a digital drawer that you can open to see multiples notes. It would use a server to store these notes but since its simple strings and low maintence, it could become a sustinable buissness if you could sell more virtual space or more diferent objects. We also wanted to create a feature to share your notes with other people so that they can show how they organize.
